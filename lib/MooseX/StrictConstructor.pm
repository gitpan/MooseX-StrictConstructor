=head1 NAME

MooseX::StrictConstructor - Make your object constructors blow up on unknown attributes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Class;

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::StrictConstructor;

    has 'size' => ...;

    # then later ...

    # this blows up because color is not a known attribute
    My::Class->new( size => 5, color => 'blue' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Simply loading this module makes your constructors "strict". If your
constructor is called with an attribute init argument that your class
does not declare, then it calls "Carp::confess()". This is a great way
to catch small typos.

=head2 Subverting Strictness

You may find yourself wanting to have your constructor accept a
parameter which does not correspond to an attribute.

In that case, you'll probably also be writing a C<BUILD()> or
C<BUILDARGS()> method to deal with that parameter. In a C<BUILDARGS()>
method, you can simply make sure that this parameter is not included
in the hash reference you return. Otherwise, in a C<BUILD()> method,
you can delete it from the hash reference of parameters.

  sub BUILD {
      my $self   = shift;
      my $params = shift;

      if ( delete $params->{do_something} ) {
          ...
      }
  }
